*.db
!simon_reader.db
# Keeping simon_reader.db if it contains seed data, otherwise might want to ignore it too if it's purely local data.
# Assuming user might want their current DB structure/content. 
# But usually we verify if it stores large binaries or sensitive info.
# For now, let's include it but typically *.db is ignored.
# Let's actually ignore *.db generally but maybe keep the schema if it was sql file.
# The user file list showed 'reader.db' and 'simon_reader.db'.
# I will ignore them for now to avoid large binary uploads unless user insists, 
# but usually for a starter project simple sqlite is fine. 
# Re-thinking: Better to ignore DBs to avoid conflicts.
